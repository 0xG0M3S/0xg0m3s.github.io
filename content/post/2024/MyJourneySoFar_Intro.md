Hello! I'm a Software engineer with a Master's degree in Computer Engineering and 8+ years of experience in developing custom web solutions across various industries. 

I was born and raised in Portugal, where my curiosity for technology and computers began. I was always fascinated by how things worked. This fascination eventually led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science in Lisbon.

My professional journey began as an assistant professor at university, where I honed my ability to simplify complex programming concepts. 

In 2015, I led a six-month freelance project with Global Change Fluxphera, developing a collaborative virtual real-time web game using Node.js and AWS, which enhanced my adaptability and technical skills. 

In 2016, I transitioned to working with OutSystems and cloud technologies, notably migrating an on-premise CRM system to the cloud. 

From 2019 to 2024, I was with IG&H, contributing to a wide range of projects, including developing a healthcare platform for diabetic patients, migrating pension fund management systems, integrating Azure services, and leading the design of a Performance Evaluation App with a microservices architecture. 

I also played a key role in digitalizing a travel agency's customer support system by integrating AI and automation, and I won first prize at a healthcare hackathon for developing a tool to streamline the acquisition of medical equipment. My last project involved implementing an ontology application for the Netherlands pension system, where I created a custom language and parser for complex condition validation.

Now, I’m eager to dive deeper into cybersecurity, particularly web security and pentesting. I’ve begun exploring various cybersecurity topics, from setting up home labs to studying for relevant certifications. I’m particularly interested in how web security can be integrated into the development process, ensuring that applications are both functional and secure. As I continue to build my knowledge and skills, I’m excited to see how this journey unfolds and how it will shape my future career.
