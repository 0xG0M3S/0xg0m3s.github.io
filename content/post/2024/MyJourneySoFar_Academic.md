In 2009, I embarked on my academic journey in Computer Engineering, which culminated in earning a master’s degree in 2015. Throughout my time at university, I developed a strong affinity for various subjects, particularly those that challenged my understanding of systems, programming languages, and security. 

I had to work on a diverse range of projects, predominantly using Java (SE 6 and SE 7), but also exploring other languages like C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, OCaml, Objective-C, and Prolog. My passion for learning about different technologies and topics was a driving force throughout my academic career.

During my studies, the courses I enjoyed the most were:

- Concurrency and Parallelism: In this course, we were tasked with analyzing a 10GB dump of Twitter data. Using Apache Storm, I processed the tweets to identify the top 10 users with the most tweets, utilizing georeferenced data. By mapping these tweets, I was able to infer the workplaces, gyms, and even the residences of these individuals—a project that deepened my understanding of big data processing and real-time analytics.

- Computer Networks: One of the most fascinating experiences was learning about and configuring protocols like TCP, UDP, DNS, BGP, and RIP on Cisco routers in a lab environment. This hands-on experience provided me with a solid foundation in understanding the stack of protocols that continue to underpin the internet today.

- Artificial Intelligence: This course introduced me to the core concepts behind neural networks, laying the groundwork for understanding the deep learning models that have become so prevalent in today’s AI landscape.

- Data Warehousing (SAIA Project): In this project, we analyzed student bidding and university results data to predict the number of openings the university should offer for the next year. This project enhanced my skills in data analysis and predictive modeling.

- Integrative Project: For my capstone project, I developed the winning application in my class—a management system for scientific conferences. The app, implemented in Objective-C for iOS 6 on the iPad, managed key speakers, regular speakers, rooms, booths, and participants, showcasing my ability to design and implement comprehensive solutions.

- Master’s Dissertation: My dissertation focused on database performance, specifically testing the Non-Monotonic Snapshot Isolation (NMSI) algorithm as a potential replacement for Snapshot Isolation (SI) in traditional databases. The goal was to evaluate whether NMSI could maintain the same ACID guarantees while improving performance—a study that deepened my expertise in database systems and transactional consistency.

My academic journey provided me with a solid foundation in computer engineering, equipping me with the skills and knowledge to tackle complex problems and explore diverse areas within the field. These experiences have been instrumental in shaping my professional path.
